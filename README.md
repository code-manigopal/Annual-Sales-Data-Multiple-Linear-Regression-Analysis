# Annual-Sales-Data-Multiple-Linear-Regression-Analysis

This report presents a comprehensive multiple linear regression analysis conducted to understand the key drivers behind a company’s Annual Sales performance. 
The dataset consists of various factors that potentially influence sales outcomes, including:  
** Ad Budget 
** Price 
** Customer Visits 
** Competitor Price
** Region (Categorical Variable)  

The core objective of this analysis is to evaluate how each predictor variable contributes to the variation in Annual Sales. By constructing a regression model, we estimate the expected sales outcomes and examine the strength and direction of these relationships.  

In addition to fitting the model, critical assumptions of linear regression—such as linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals—were assessed to ensure the validity of the results.
The findings and interpretations derived from this analysis provide valuable insights for business decision-making, particularly in areas such as pricing strategy, marketing investments, and regional sales planning.
