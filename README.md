# Annual-Sales-Data-Multiple-Linear-Regression-Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive multiple linear regression analysis conducted to understand the key drivers behind a company’s **Annual Sales** performance. 

The dataset consists of various factors that potentially influence sales outcomes, including:  
**1. Ad Budget**

**2. Price**

**3. Customer Visits**

**4 Competitor Price**

**5 Region (Categorical Variable)**

The core objective of this analysis is to evaluate how each predictor variable contributes to the variation in Annual Sales. By constructing a regression model, we estimate the expected sales outcomes and examine the strength and direction of these relationships.  

In addition to fitting the model, critical assumptions of linear regression—such as **linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals**—were assessed to ensure the validity of the results.
The findings and interpretations derived from this analysis provide valuable insights for business decision-making, particularly in areas such as pricing strategy, marketing investments, and regional sales planning.
